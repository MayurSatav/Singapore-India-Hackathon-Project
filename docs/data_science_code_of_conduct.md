# Equinor Data Science Code of Conduct

***

## Authorship and validity
This document was developed by the Data Scientists within the Digital Centre of Excellence of Equinor (DCoE) and is endorsed by the unit.
This code of conduct is derived from the “Data Science Code of Professional Conduct” written by the Data Science Association. The full version is available at http://www.datascienceassn.org/code-of-conduct.html. For definitions of the terminology in this code of conduct please consult the full version.
This code of conduct attempts to distill the fuller code to a more manageable level, a code which is easier to communicate whilst (hopefully) still retaining the spirit of the Data Association’s code of conduct. We have done this through highlighting what we believe to be the most salient points. Points conspicuous in their absence should not be assumed to be invalid. The full code of conduct is embraced in its entirety by the Data Scientists here at Equinor’s DCoE.
The aim of this code of conduct is to help ensure the quality of Data Science carried out at Equinor is at least in accordance with the guidelines set out below. This includes the work of Data Scientists within the DCoE, other internal resources and external partners and vendors. Indeed, all data science which is delivered to Equinor.
Key tenets are competence, honesty, scientific integrity and repeatability.
The rules detailed here are intended to augment relevant laws and regulations which are valid in the local where the data science work is being delivered (e.g. the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation). In the event of any perceived conflict between this code of conduct and local rules and regulations it is the local rules and regulations which take precedence. 

## Success criteria and validation

* **Rule 0:** The data scientist shall, in collaboration with the client, develop success criteria for the purposes of establishing metrics by which the quality of the delivery can be assessed. Success criteria shall:
  * **a)**	As much as possible, be based on objective, industry accepted quantitative metrics such as precision and recall.
  * **b)**	Be agreed as early as possible in the data science delivery
  * **c)**	Remain unchanged throughout the delivery, unless it is agreed with the client that the success criteria are not appropriate
  * **d)**	Not be repeatedly adjusted in light of unfavourable evidence. When re-establishing success criteria (as of rule 0c), great care must be taken to ensure that this will change will support the quality of the delivery
  * **e)**	Where quantitative metrics cannot be agreed due to the nature of the problem, e.g. language models, anomaly detection with low rate of known anomalies, an honest assessment of the quality of the delivery is still required
  * **f)**	Success criteria should focus on generalisation of models and workflows.

## Client Communication

* **Rule 1:** A data scientist shall consult with the client about any real, perceived and potentially hidden risks in relying on data science results.

* **Rule 2:** A data scientist shall explain data science results to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the data science.
Confidential Information

* **Rule 3:** Confidential information is information that the data scientist creates, develops, receives, uses or learns during employment as a data scientist for a client, either working directly in-house as an employee of an organization or as an independent professional. It includes information that is not generally known by the public about the client, including client affiliates, employees, customers or other parties with whom the client has a relationship and who have an expectation of confidentiality. The data scientist has a professional duty to protect all confidential information, regardless of its form or format, from the time of its creation or receipt until its authorised disposal.

* **Rule 4:** A data scientist shall make reasonable efforts to prevent the inadvertent or unauthorized disclosure of, or unauthorized access to, information relating to the representation of a client, which means:
  * **a)** Not displaying, reviewing or discussing confidential information in public places, in the presence of third parties or that may be overheard;
  * **b)** Not e-mailing confidential information outside of the organization or professional practice to a personal e-mail account or otherwise removing confidential information from the client by removing hard copies or copying it to any form of recordable digital media device; and
  * **c)** Communicating confidential information only to client employees and authorized agents (such as legal professionals or external auditors) who have a legitimate business reason to know the information.

* **Rule 5:** A data scientist shall comply with client policies that apply to the acceptance, proper use and handling of confidential information, as well as any written agreements between the data scientist and the client relating to confidential information.

* **Rule 6:** A data scientist shall protect client confidential information after termination of work for the client.
* **Rule 7:** A data scientist shall return any and all confidential information in possession or control upon termination of the data scientist - client relationship and, if requested, execute an affidavit affirming compliance with obligations relating to confidential information.

## Data Science Evidence, Quality of Data and Quality of Evidence

* **Rule 8:** A data scientist shall inform the client of all data science results and material facts known to the data scientist that will enable the client to make informed decisions, whether or not the data science evidence is adverse.

* **Rule 9:** The data scientist understands that bad or uncertain data quality may compromise data science professional practice and may communicate a false reality or promote an illusion of understanding. The data scientist shall take reasonable measures to protect the client from relying and making decisions based on bad or uncertain data quality.

* **Rule 10:** The data scientist understands that evidence may be weak or strong or uncertain and shall take reasonable measures to protect the client from relying and making decisions based on weak or uncertain evidence.

* **Rule 11:** A data scientist shall not knowingly:
  * **a)** fail to use scientific methods in performing data science;
  * **b)** fail to convey the quality of evidence in a reasonable and understandable manner for the client;
  * **c)** claim weak or uncertain evidence is strong evidence;
  * **d)** misuse weak or uncertain evidence to communicate a false reality or promote an illusion of understanding;
  * **e)** fail to convey the quality of data in a reasonable and understandable manner for the client;
  * **f)** claim bad or uncertain data quality is good data quality;
  * **g)** misuse bad or uncertain data quality to communicate a false reality or promote an illusion of understanding;
  * **h)** engage in cherry-picking (pointing to individual cases or data that seem to confirm a particular position, while ignoring a significant portion of related cases or data that may contradict that position of data or data science evidence);
  * **i)** fail to attempt to replicate data science results;
  * **j)** fail to disclose that data science results could not be replicated;
  * **k)** misuse data science results to communicate a false reality or promote an illusion of understanding;
  * **l)** fail to disclose failed experiments or disconfirming evidence known to the data scientist to be directly adverse to the position of the client;
  * **m)** offer evidence that the data scientist knows to be false. If a data scientist questions the quality of data or evidence the data scientist must disclose this to the client. If a data scientist has offered material evidence and the data scientist comes to know of its falsity, the data scientist shall take reasonable remedial measures, including disclosure to the client. A data scientist may disclose and label evidence the data scientist reasonably believes is false.

* **Rule 12:** A data scientist shall use reasonable diligence when assigning value and meaning to the following concepts when conducting data science:
  * **a)** "Statistically Significant"
  * **b)** "Correlation"
  * **c)** "Spurious Correlation"
  * **d)** "Causation"

* **Rule 13:** A data scientist shall not present incomplete evidence as real data science evidence. A data scientist may present a theory constituting incomplete evidence but shall label and clearly communicate the use of incomplete evidence.

* **Rule 14:** A data scientist shall use the data science method which consists of the following steps:
  * **a)** Careful observations of data, data sets and relationships between data;
  * **b)** Deduction of meaning from the data and different data relationships;
  * **c)** Formation of hypotheses;
  * **d)** Experimental or observational testing of the validity of the hypotheses. To be termed scientific, a method of inquiry must be based on empirical and measurable evidence subject to specific principles of reasoning.
